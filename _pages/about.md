My academic interests are in the field of Electrical Engineering, in particular
in the analysis and design of electrical machines and drives and the related control systems.

I got my MSc and the PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of Padova
in 2005 and 2009 respectively.

Between 2009 and 2012 I have been working at the Electric Drive Laboratory
of the University of Padova with a post doc position.

Between 2012 and 2016 I have been with the Faculty of Science and Technology
of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano where I become
Associate Professor in 2015.

Since 2016 I'm Associate Professor with the Department of Industrial Engineering
of the University of Padova.

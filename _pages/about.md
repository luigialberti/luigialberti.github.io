My academic interests lie in the field of Electrical Engineering,
particularly in the analysis and design of electrical machines and drives,
as well as the related control systems.

I obtained my MSc and PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University
of Padova in 2005 and 2009, respectively.

From 2009 to 2012, I worked at the Electric Drive Laboratory of
the University of Padova as a postdoctoral researcher.

From 2012 to 2016, I was with the Faculty of Science and Technology
at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Italy), where I became an Associate
Professor in 2015.

In 2016, I returned to the Department of Industrial Engineering at
the University of Padova, where I am currently a Full Professor.

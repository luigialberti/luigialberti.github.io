In the paper Koil, a free software which allows the synthesis and the analysis of the windings for rotating alternating current machines is presented. Koil development started some years ago with the main aim of automating repetitive tasks during windings computation. Then the software has been further improved and has been shared as a free software package with the hope to be useful also for other researchers and designers in the electrical machine field.
Koil allows both the synthesis and the analysis of a winding. The adopted algorithm is based on the star of slots. In the paper a pragmatic approach is adopted with emphasis on use of case of Koil and practical applications. The theoretical background is briefly recalled reporting the main equations implemented in the software. References are given for each applications for the reader that would like to further elaborate.

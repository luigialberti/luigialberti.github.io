This is a laboratory course (practical) where an electric drive is
designed and realized using a microprocessor.


The following topics are covered in the course:
* Microprocessor programming (TI C2000 family) using C code (TI CSS)
  and model based approach (PLECS).
* Communication, GPIOs, ADC, PWM, encoder and other relevant
  microprocessor peripherals.
* Practical exercises with a demonstrative board.
* Practical implementation of a drive with a synchronous motor
